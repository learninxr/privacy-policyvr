        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 11 December 2025</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Engineering VR</strong> (“the App”) is developed and published by <strong>learninxr</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”).
            We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how information is handled.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not collect, store, or process any personal data</strong> from users.
            The App does not request or retain information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or login credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App requires the use of a VR headset for interaction. Standard device-level inputs (headset tracking, controller input,
            and device performance data) may be used locally on the device to enable functionality. This information is processed
            locally by the device and is <strong>not transmitted to or stored by us</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, cloud storage, or external servers. The App is built using Unity,
            and no Unity analytics or data-collection services are enabled for this application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because we collect no user data, we do not share any user data with third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Meta / Platform Data</h2>
        <p>
            As the App runs on Meta Quest (or similar) devices, Meta or the platform provider may independently collect platform-level
            information such as crash reports or device identifiers. That data collection is governed by Meta’s (or the platform’s)
            privacy policies, not by this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can review Meta’s privacy information here:<br />
            <a href="https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-center/
            </a>
        </p>

        <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are below the age required by local law to consent
            to data processing, please do not provide personal information in the App.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
            Because the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal user data at risk of exposure from our side.
            All processing required for gameplay runs locally on the user’s VR device.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated “Last Updated” date.
        </p>
